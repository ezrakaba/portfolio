## Types of Treatment

### Medication

Psychiatric medications can also help make other treatments, such as psychotherapy, more effective. The best medications for you will depend on your particular situation and how your body responds to the medication.

### Psychotherapy

> Psychotherapy, also called talk therapy, involves talking about your condition and related issues with a mental health professional. During psychotherapy, you learn about your condition and your moods, feelings, thoughts and behavior. With the insights and knowledge you gain, you can learn coping and stress management skills.
> 
> 
> There are many types of psychotherapy, each with its own approach to improving your mental well-being. Psychotherapy often can be successfully completed in a few months, but in some cases, long-term treatment may be needed. It can take place one-on-one, in a group or with family members.

> 
> Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a short-term, goal-oriented therapy that focuses on the link between our thoughts (cognition) and our actions (behavior). It is intended to help people change thought patterns that cause unhealthy, unproductive, or incapacitating behavior.

> 
> DBT differs from CBT in that it teaches you that your experiences are real and shows how to accept yourself. The treatment usually consists of both one-on-one sessions and therapist-led group sessions where the participants develop and practice skills and behaviors needed for a more manageable daily life.

> 
> ACT is an action-oriented approach where you learn to stop avoiding, denying, and struggling with your inner emotions and, instead, accept that these deeper feelings are appropriate responses to certain situations that should not prevent them from moving forward. With this understanding, you begin to accept your hardships and commit to making necessary changes in behavior, regardless of what is going on in life.

### Treatment Programs

The environment, and level or type of care, will depend on multiple factors: the nature and severity of the person’s mental condition, their physical health, and the type of treatment prescribed or indicated.

Inpatient hospitals provide treatment to more severely ill mental health patients, usually for less than 30 days.

## Maintaining a Healthy Lifestyle

> **Mental health is part of overall health**. Just like we can’t be well without good mental health, we can’t be healthy if we neglect the rest of our body. When dealing with a mental health condition it can be easy to fall into a rut, relying solely on medication or therapy to be your cure and forgetting to take good care of your body. However, paying attention to lifestyle choices is important for recovery as well.
