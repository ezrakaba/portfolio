**Doing Life ep 1**

Recently I realized im lazy. Alarms do the most to wake me up.
Waking up seconds before my alarm goes off is always nice, but that’s not the best part for me.
Laying in silence afterwards, surrounded by the familiar comfort of my home is.As I take a deep breath I slowly become aware of my body as my essence fills my arms and legs.Not fully awake, my brain slowly fires up as I start to go over what I have planned for the day.

In this semi-awake state, safely in my blanket, I feel I can conquer the world. I allow my mind to wander, cradled by the quiet of the room.

I am an active dreamer. Often I wake in the middle of a dream and i’m left to wonder what was in the next scene. Within the safety of my dreams, I dive into and swim through deep oceans, I float through space to baby Pluto and even swim through hot magma in the Everest, all in a single night. There is always a second of excitement when I open my eyes and become aware that I am awake and no longer dreaming. It’s a little sad but I’m always overjoyed to be alive.

I think that the fact that we do not have a clue on what the next 6 months hold makes life as good as the dreams we have every night, results are not instant but the fact that there is a possibility of things changing for the better is a thrill by itself. Practicing being in the moment has been a key part of my life through this year, reducing the wander one holds and just being has proven to work really well for me. Doing things i would have ignored to do more important ones is one of the many things i try to do. Over a set period you see the effects i promise, and over the years, well who knows, Ezra might be on the Nasa team and literally floating to Pluto or on an excursion to go climb the Everest, thing is who knows? right.

I am now on my third semester of my program and looking back first year isnt as far back as i thought it would feel. Im now en route to finishing this thing but while im at it my next series is on a little portfolio project i have been doing, plus a dash of “ramblings”.

haha, goodbye lovelies
